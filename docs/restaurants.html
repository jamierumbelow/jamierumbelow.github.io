  Recommending restaurants is fun! There are few things that give people more
  unfiltered joy than the gut-swell of happiness after taking a bite of
  something delicious and surprising –– and the knowledge that you made that
  happen.
</p>

<p>
  But recommending restaurants is also a little dangerous. If you eat out very
  often (~3 times / week) you can expect to have ~9,300 meals over a 60-year
  adulthood. So each meal has to count! You should respect the time and money
  that people will spend based on your recommendations.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, here is a tentative list of restaurant recommendations, organised
  by city. I optimise for deliciousness and consistency and inventiveness, in
  that order.
</p>

<p>
  It is incomplete – and possibly inaccurate! – but I'll do my best to respect
  your time and money. If you have a disappointing meal at any of the places
  listed below,
  <a href="mailto:jamie@jamierumbelow.net">do let me know</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, this list will invariably be a reflection of my own biases and
  cultural baggage, as well as my particular gastronomic priorities; your
  mileage may vary, or I may have committed a grave sin of omission. If so,
  <a href="mailto:jamie@jamierumbelow.net">you know what to do</a>.

<p><u>'Modern European' / Franco-Italian</u></p>

<p>
  <a href="https://stjohnrestaurant.com/a/restaurants/smithfield">St John</a>
  in Clerkenwell is the beginning and end of London food, and for good reason.
  Michelin-starred food with absolutely none of the carefully manicured,
  tweezered plates. Ales, pies, classic British and French cooking.
  Nose-to-tail, so lots of offal, but don’t let that put you off(al). There is
  very little better cooking in London. My routine is a welsh rarebit and a pint
  of black velvet while I’m deciding what to eat, and you must always always
  have the madeleines with a glass of calvados or perhaps veille prune to finish
  a meal. No matter how full you think you are, you’re never too full for a
  madeleine.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://thequalitychophouse.com/">The Quality Chop House</a>
  is always a really special experience, and worth every penny, for classic
  anglo-franco-bistro fare. Emphasis on the meat, of course, but almost every
  dish is punch-you-in-the-face tasty. The neighbouring
  <a href="http://www.qualitywinesfarringdon.com/">Quality Wines</a>
  is a joyous Italian-tinted wine bar with really brilliant cooking, most
  famously these wonderfully sweet-savoury pig fat cannoli. The wine list, as
  you’d imagine, is extremely good at both.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the better Italian small-ish plates in the city can be found at
  <a href="http://brightrestaurant.co.uk/">Bright</a>
  in London Fields. It’s part of the
  <a href="https://www.pfranco.co.uk/">P Franco</a>
  group of restaurants, lots of natural wine and Italian-focussed food. You’ll
  have a lot of fun getting pissed on the terrazzo with a bottle of something
  weird and biodynamic, and eating your way through the bar menu. Lovely people,
  lovely negroni, lovely food.
</p>

<p>
  Round the corner from Bright there’s
  <a href="https://www.pophamsbakery.com/">Popham’s Bakery</a>, known for very
  large baked goods and fancy flat whites. They’re less well known for their
  extremely good lunch pastas.
  <a href="https://www.burroesalvia.co.uk/">Burro e Salvia</a>
  a bit further south, on Redchurch St, is more deli than restaurant but
  similarly sells extremely good pasta fresca to take away. And in neighbouring
  Netil Market there's
  <a href="https://www.sonorataqueria.com/">Sonora Tacquería</a>, one of the few
  actually enjoyable Mexican restaurants in London.
</p>

<p>
  Gun to my head, my favourite restaurant in London is
  <a href="https://www.brawn.co/">Brawn</a>, which is franco-italian and so much
  more. I don’t have much to say other than it makes me feel more at home than
  any other spot in the city. Eat here. Drink here. Be here.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.trullorestaurant.com/">Trullo</a> is the closest thing in
  London I’ve found to Trattoria Cibreo (my favourite Florentine restaurant; see
  Florence section below). It’s not cheap, but the atmos, the wine list, the
  calibre of the cooking is extremely high. You may have heard of their sister
  restaurant <a href="https://www.padella.co/">Padella</a>, which is also
  definitely worth visiting, but Trullo elevates the whole thing a bit and
  brings it more in line with the experiences of long lazy dinners in the Tuscan
  countryside.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.40maltbystreet.com/">40 Maltby St</a> is nominally a wine
  bar, but, like P Franco, is really about the food. Brilliant small-plates
  orbit around natural and biodynamic wines. Also from the 4MS team (but really
  the brainchild of Anna Tobias, who, for a while took up the pans at P Franco)
  is the recently-opened <a href="https://www.cafe-deco.co.uk/">Café Deco</a> in
  Bloomsbury. Anna's cooking is St John-level good with the same lack of
  pretentions to fussiness.
</p>

<p><u>Asian / Asian-inspired</u></p>

<p>
  <a href="https://barshurestaurant.co.uk/">Barshu</a> is reliably good for
  proper Chengdu-style Sichuan cooking and hotpot, though make sure you take a
  large group as the portions are enormous (try the fish fragrant aubergine, dan
  dan noodles, ma po tofu and anything else with ‘ma la’ [hot and numbing]
  written in front of it).
</p>

<p>
  My favourite takeaway-style Chinese takeaway in London is
  <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/brick-lane/hua-brick-ln"
    >Lucky Dog</a
  >
  on Brick Lane – order from the authentic menu (there are two different menus)
  and try the dry fried sweet-sour pork, pork mince with green beans and chilli,
  cold sesame noodles, cold chicken and chilli oil, also the BBQ skewers
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.dumplingshack.co.uk/">Dumpling Shack</a> in Spitalfields
  market is truly excellent (get the pork and leek jiaozi). There’s also a
  brilliant chongqing noodle soup (ma la again) popup at the
  <a href="https://jackalopelondon.com/">Jackalope</a> in Marylebone, which is a
  good pub independently of the food.
  <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/31/master-wei-london-wc1-restaurant-review-grace-dent"
    >Master Wei</a
  >
  and <a href="http://www.xianimpression.co.uk/">Xi’an Impression</a> are both
  from the same chef and both really worth trying, as is
  <a href="http://xianbiangbiangnoodles.com/">Xi’an Biang Biang Noodles</a>,
  which is one of the finest quality-price ratios in the city. Finally,
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=silk+road+camberwell&oq=silk+road"
    >Silk Road</a
  >
  in Camberwell for Uyghur / Xinjiang cooking, especially the skewers and tomato
  egg noodles.
</p>

<p>
  An important place that might be suitable for a long boozy dinner is
  <a href="https://www.smokinggoatbar.com/">Smoking Goat</a> (incidentally right
  next to my flat!) The food is thai, but it’s inspired by the street food scene
  in Bangkok, so there’s lots of regional thai dishes adapted in a
  London-friendly way. Lots of blues and rockabilly records, excellent Five
  Points XPA sold in frozen 2/3 pint glasses, a fancy cocktail list. The laabs –
  dry-fried curries – are always aggressively spicy and delicious (much like
  myself). The chilli fish sauce chicken wings is one of my top-five all-time
  favourite dishes, and the lardo fried rice cannot be missed.
</p>

<p>
  I love <a href="https://www.koya.co.uk/">Koya</a> in soho for incredibly
  thoughtful, delicate udon.
  <a href="https://www.caytrerestaurant.co.uk/">Cây Tre</a> for Vietnamese and
  their Bahn Mi takeaway opposite are also extremely good.
  <a href="https://www.blackaxemangal.com/">Black Axe Mangal</a>, if they ever
  reopen, is a bizarre, hard to categorise, tiny sort-of kebab restaurant from a
  former St John sous-chef next to Trullo that I’m including in the Asian
  section because they do the best ma po tofu in the city. Also the flatbreads,
  and the heavy metal, and the negronis, and the graffito cocks drawn on the
  floor. Its lack of any sort of deference really belies some staggeringly good
  quality cooking.
</p>

<p>
  Last, but not least, I really like
  <a href="https://thelaughingheartlondon.com/">The Laughing Heart</a>, nestled
  on Hackney Road. More of a traditional tasting menu, ‘modern European’ with
  heavy pan-Asian accents. The food is really high calibre and the
  owner/sommelier, a charming Antipodean man (almost everybody in London
  hospitality is for some reason Antipodean), always gets me so wonderfully
  drunk that I can never remember his name.

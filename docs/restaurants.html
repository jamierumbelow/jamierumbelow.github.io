        <p>Recommending restaurants is fun! There are few things that give people more unfiltered joy than the gut-swell of happiness after taking a bite of something delicious and surprising – and the knowledge that you made that happen.</p>
<p>But recommending restaurants is also a little dangerous. If you eat out very often (~3 times / week) you can expect to have ~9,300 meals over a 60-year adulthood. So each meal has to count. You should respect the time and money that people will spend based on your recommendations.</p>
<p>Therefore, here is a tentative list of restaurant recommendations, organised by city. I optimise for deliciousness and consistency and inventiveness, in that order.</p>
<p>It is incomplete – and possibly inaccurate! – but I'll do my best to respect your time and money. If you have a disappointing meal at any of the places listed below, <a href="mailto:jamie@jamierumbelow.net" target="_blank">do let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this list will invariably be a reflection of my own biases and cultural baggage, as well as my particular gastronomic priorities; your mileage may vary, or I may have committed a grave sin of omission. If so, <a href="mailto:jamie@jamierumbelow.net" target="_blank">you know what to do</a>.</p>

        <p>When building a software business, you need to select a market.</p>
<p>Good markets are normally described <em>quantitively</em>: how big is the market? Is it growing, or is it stagnant, and at what rate? What is the TAM – the total market size for your product? What is the SAM – the amount of the TAM you can reasonably capture if everything goes well?</p>
<p>One lesson we learned building <a href="https://buildwithtract.com/">Tract</a> is that there are <em>qualitative</em> features of markets, features of a market that make it favourable to sell into but aren’t captured by the usual market sizing metrics. I discuss three categories of market qualities below.</p>
<p>None of the considerations below are definitive, nor is this an exhaustive list. There are great companies built in difficult, low-quality markets, and plenty of good quality markets where it’s still difficult to sell. And lower market quality works as a barrier to entry, which means once you’ve cracked it, your business is (in theory) more defensible.</p>
<h2>Willingness to buy</h2>
<p>If you want to sell a product, your customers need to be willing to buy it.</p>
<p>Buyer willingness is notoriously hard to determine from desk research. Certain industries, like hospitals or governments, have a reputation for unwilling customers that is well-deserved. Others are challenging, but achievable. There are some, such as software developer tooling, where there are very few restrictions; software engineers have wide latitude to buy, the willingness to try new tools, and the cash to do so.</p>
<p>Some customers do have a willingness to buy, but are a bit further along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">adoption curve</a>. These customers might need good references or existing logos to get to a purchase. In these cases, you can identify the leading-edge of your customer profile and get those early adopters in for free or on some heavily-discounted design partnership, and then leverage their reputation and feedback to win the more conventional customers (you are likely to do this sort of thing anyway.)</p>
<p>A third thing to consider is whether your customers are likely to try a new solution that is incomplete. Are they willing and able to integrate a work-in-progress into their existing workflows? If not, you either need a point solution that solves a really legible pain-point, or you need to invest more development ahead of time. At Tract, we found that our design partners needed more features than we were willing to build in order to convert to paying customers; this is a sign that you have a low market quality and your early life is going to be difficult.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that willingness to buy is often obscured by how many competitors there are. Some companies manage to embed themselves in industries with a low willingness-to-buy because they had an existing network, or because the need at the time was great. But willingness-to-buy is not a static thing; if there are solid competitors in a space already, that might reduce the marginal customer’s willingness-to-buy relative to your new solution, so it’s useful to think about regardless of how crowded the space may seem. Will someone who has tried four solutions try a fifth? Watch out for fatigue.</p>
<h3>Questions to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>How willing are customers to try new products?</li>
<li>How willing are customers to try new products without existing customer references / logos?</li>
<li>How willing are customers to try incomplete products, or products that only cover a subset of their use cases?</li>
<li>Do customers allocate budget to try new products?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>If your average customer has a reasonable willingness-to-buy, you still need to be able to get to her. A market can be huge but inaccessible if hidden behind layers of procurement or have an idiosyncratic operational language.</p>
<p>Some markets are heavily concentrated, such as Fortune 500 finance teams and hyperscaler devops groups, and therefore sit in a predictable cluster. They attend the same sorts of conferences, respond to the same sorts of marketing channels. If you are able to identify where they are and how to talk to them, you can at least get on their radar easily. More distributed markets, such as many SMEs and independent contractors, are much more difficult: you’ll need to do as much marketing as sales, or otherwise sell via some kind of existing aggregator.</p>
<p>You should also think about whether gatekeeping matters. A single point of contact with a discretionary budget means you can identify whom to speak to quickly and get them over the line. Some businesses require many people – finance, legal, ops, exec, IT – to decide how a budget gets spent, and these can drag deals into multi-month- or even multi-year-long cycles.</p>
<p>Switching costs compound these problems. Proprietary data formats, multi-year service contracts, or heavy on-prem installations create economic moats for incumbents and raise the threshold for whether a lead can easily become a customer, even when the buyer is convinced.</p>
<h3>Questions to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is your market in one accessible place? Or is it distributed in lots of places?</li>
<li>Is it simple to identify the person who decides on how that budget is spent? Is it simple to pitch them?</li>
<li>Are there any notable switching costs? Are incumbants locked in?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate with the customer’s existing tech stack? How easy is it to integrate with the customer’s existing operations?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback and compounding</h2>
<p><a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/106513-12">Charlie Songhurst</a> once pointed out that if you sell software to somebody like <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/">Patrick Collison</a>, you’re going to receive a bunch of feedback at 3am the week after the deal closes. When you’re still trying to find product-market fit, and long afterwards, rapid feedback loops are everything.</p>
<p>When a buyer commits in days rather than months, each sales cycle doubles as product research; you iterate while your pipeline is still warm. An easy way to check is how quickly somebody responds to emails. This isn’t just a signal that they’re engaged, it’s also a signal that they take your time seriously. These sorts of customers, those who articulate their problems and concerns clearly and reproducibly and most importantly quickly, are an incredible thing to find. If your market has a density of them, all else equal it is an excellent market.</p>
<p>You should also consider how easily feedback from customers generalises. If 80% of your feedback clusters around the same workflow gap, you get a product roadmap that applies across the segment. If every account wants a different integration, you can learn much less from a given interaction, and you’ll compound at a slower rate.</p>
<h3>Questions to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do they make purchasing decisions quickly?</li>
<li>Do they respond to their emails quickly?</li>
<li>Do they provide high quality feedback? Do they have a propensity to offer it?</li>
<li>How easily does customer feedback generalise across customers?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Does market quality matter more than market sizing?</h2>
<p>I have come to believe that market quality often matters more than market sizing for early stage companies. This is for a few reasons:</p>
<p>Market sizing is, in many cases, more difficult to observe than market quality. Typical approaches to market sizing are to work top-down, where you . Alternatively, you can work bottom-up: . Data on a lot of these metrics are scarce. And in both cases, it can be easy to gerrymander the numbers to give yourself a bigger TAM and therefore make yourself believe it is a big enough. market. The choice of variables matter, and founders’ confirmation bias is a powerful determinant of these choices.</p>
<p>Market quality, on the other hand, can be observed much more readily identifying a customer profile and speaking to them.</p>
<p>Secondly, market sizing is often a projection forward based on the current world. The current world is a world without your startup. This means that you are evaluating the market size on the counterfactual where your startup doesn’t exist. But many of the most impressive startups create new markets, or new demand within existing markets, by their very existence. By reducing the costs of taxis in developed cities, companies like Uber and Lyft induced demand in a set of customers for taxi rides. And much of that demand came from people who previously rarely, if ever, used taxis, meaning the market value of their possible rides did not appear in the numbers one would have used to determine market size in a world without them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and most importantly, a large market is important to gain conviction that this startup could reach venture-scale one day. But it is much less useful to gain conviction that this startup will be able to do so <em>today</em>. If your growth is bottlenecked by market quality considerations, a large TAM is chimerical: you won’t be able to access it even if it’s there.</p>

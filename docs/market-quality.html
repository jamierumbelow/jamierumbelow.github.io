        <p>When building a software business, you need to select a market.</p>
<p>Good markets are normally described <em>quantitively</em>: how big is the market? Is it growing, or is it stagnant, and at what rate? What is the TAM – the total market size for your product? What is the SAM – the amount of the TAM you can reasonably capture if everything goes well?</p>
<p>One lesson we learned building <a href="https://buildwithtract.com/">Tract</a> is that there are <em>qualitative</em> features of markets, features of a market that make it favourable to sell into but aren’t captured by the usual market sizing metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is often obscured by how many competitors there are</li>
<li>PMs will try anything which is why there can be lots of solutions</li>
<li>Will someone who has tried 4 solutions try a 5th one?</li>
<li>Google 37th search engine</li>
<li>Number of competitors not a good test</li>
<li>Fatigue - proptech fatigue, AI</li>
<li>Software engs aren’t bothered!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Willingness to buy</h2>
<p>If you want to sell a product, your customers need to be willing to buy it.</p>
<p>Buyer willingness is notoriously hard to determine from desk research. Certain industries, like X, have a reputation for unwilling customers that is well-deserved. Others, such as Y, are challenging, but achievable. There are some, such as software developer tooling, where there are very few.</p>
<ul>
<li>How willing are customers to try new products?</li>
<li>How willing are customers to try new products without existing customer references / logos?</li>
<li>How willing are customers to try incomplete products, or products that only cover a subset of their use cases?</li>
<li>Do customers allocate budget to try new products?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is your market in one accessible place? Or is it distributed in lots of places?</li>
<li>Is it simple to identify the person who decides on how that budget is spent? Is it simple to pitch them?</li>
<li>Are there any notable switching costs? Are incumbants locked in?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate with the customer’s existing tech stack? How easy is it to integrate with the customer’s existing operations?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback and compounding</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do they make purchasing decisions quickly?</li>
<li>Do they respond to their emails quickly?</li>
<li>Do they provide high quality feedback? Do they have a propensity to offer it?</li>
<li>How easily does customer feedback generalise across customers?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Does market quality matter more than market sizing?</h2>
<p>I have come to believe that market quality often matters more than market sizing for early stage companies. This is for a few reasons:</p>
<p>Market sizing is, in many cases, more difficult to observe than market quality. Typical approaches to market sizing are to work top-down, where you . Alternatively, you can work bottom-up: . Data on a lot of these metrics are scarce. And in both cases, it can be easy to gerrymander the numbers to give yourself a bigger TAM and therefore make yourself believe it is a big enough. market. The choice of variables matter, and founders’ confirmation bias is a powerful determinant of these choices.</p>
<p>Market quality, on the other hand, can be observed much more readily identifying a customer profile and speaking to them.</p>
<p>Secondly, market sizing is often a projection forward based on the current world. The current world is a world without your startup. This means that you are evaluating the market size on the counterfactual where your startup doesn’t exist. But many of the most impressive startups create new markets, or new demand within existing markets, by their very existence. By reducing the costs of taxis in developed cities, companies like Uber and Lyft induced demand in a set of customers for taxi rides. And much of that demand came from people who previously rarely, if ever, used taxis, meaning the market value of their possible rides did not appear in the numbers one would have used to determine market size in a world without them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and most importantly, a large market is important to gain conviction that this startup could reach venture-scale one day. But it is much less useful to gain conviction that this startup will be able to do so <em>today</em>. If your growth is bottlenecked by market quality considerations, a large TAM is chimerical: you won’t be able to access it even if it’s there.</p>

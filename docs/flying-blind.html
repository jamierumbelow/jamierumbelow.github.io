        <p>James Scott <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State" target="_blank">argues</a> that the state seeks to control what it can observe. But today’s state is often flying blind, unable to force legibility onto the phenomena for which it has a democratic demand to control.</p>
<p>What is the British state unable to track?</p>
<ul>
<li>how many people are in the country?</li>
<li>how many houses were built last year?</li>
<li>how many houses are left vacant?</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/mattwridley/status/1922916267737878593" target="_blank">How effective are the charities that receive state funding?</a>?</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/jo3hill/status/1928802941982380295" target="_blank">How much energy do individuals use?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly80q3w5g7o" target="_blank">How many buildings still fitted with the type of cladding that exacerbated the Grenfell fire?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/684ffae201d3b0e7b62da722/National_Audit_on_Group-based_Child_Sexual_Exploitation_and_Abuse.pdf" target="_blank">The scale of child sexual exploitation, especially group-based (“grooming gangs”)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of well-documented problems with the UK's official statistical body, the ONS. As a result, we don't really know <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2025/paper-says-uk-economic-data-issues-reflected-defective-methodology/" target="_blank">how much the economy is growing</a> or <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61164629-9b9a-472b-aaae-9d850da1291e" target="_blank">what are the inflation figures really are.</a></p>
<p>International examples?</p>
<ul>
<li>DOGE debates <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2025/05/accounting-for-state-capacity/" target="_blank">reveal</a> if nothing else that the federal budget is obscure even to people responsible for overseeing it</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource misallocation, Hayek information problems</li>
<li>Democratic legitimacy: decision-makers need to be able to effect the changes for which they are elected</li>
<li>Quality of governance: policy should respond to the way the world actually is, not the way the world appears to be at its most legible points</li>
<li>Private sector and civil society depend on reliable state data to plan investment</li>
<li>Historical precedent: successful statebuilding efforts in the past are those where state capacity enables observability (Domesday book, Napoleon’s cadastre, 19th century Prussian civil service); deep failures have been where observability was limited (Scott egs, Gosplan, mid-century US urban renewal)</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<ul>
<li>These are complex things to measure</li>
<li>Legacy IT, fragmented mandates, data silos, devolution, latency</li>
<li>British aversion to state control - we find it quite satisfying that the state is distant (cf ID cards)</li>
<li>Opacity rents - arbitrage opportunities from informational asymmetries</li>
<li>Lack of institutional capacities - gutted by austerity, cf trains you need a good buyer, a lot of the British state lacks good technical capacity, civil service not structured to reward it
<ul>
<li>In some important senses ‘observability’ is the most important measure of state capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Audit?</li>
<li>Everythingism</li>
</ul>

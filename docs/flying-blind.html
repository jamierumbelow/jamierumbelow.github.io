        <p>James Scott <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State" target="_blank">argues</a> that the state seeks to control what it can observe. But today’s government is flying blind, unable to make legible the things it wants – or has been asked by the electorate – to control.</p>
<p>This means that the British state does not have accurate answers to many important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people are in the country?</li>
<li>How many houses were built last year?</li>
<li>How many houses are left vacant?</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/mattwridley/status/1922916267737878593" target="_blank">How effective are the charities that receive state funding?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/jo3hill/status/1928802941982380295" target="_blank">How much energy do individuals use?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly80q3w5g7o" target="_blank">How many buildings still fitted with the type of cladding that exacerbated the Grenfell fire?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/684ffae201d3b0e7b62da722/National_Audit_on_Group-based_Child_Sexual_Exploitation_and_Abuse.pdf" target="_blank">What is the scale of child sexual exploitation, especially group-based (“grooming gangs”)?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of well-documented problems with the UK's official statistical body, the ONS. As a result, we don't really know <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2025/paper-says-uk-economic-data-issues-reflected-defective-methodology/" target="_blank">how much the economy is growing</a> or <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61164629-9b9a-472b-aaae-9d850da1291e" target="_blank">what are the inflation figures really are.</a></p>
<p>Here are some international examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DOGE debates <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2025/05/accounting-for-state-capacity/" target="_blank">reveal</a>, if nothing else, that the federal budget is obscure even to the people responsible for overseeing it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Democratic legitimacy and trust in government</strong>. Decision-makers need to be able to effect the changes for which they are elected.</li>
<li><strong>Value for money</strong>. We are spending a lot of money to operate the state. It would be good to know that money is getting the outcomes we're paying for.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of governance</strong>. Policy should respond to the way the world actually is, not the way the world appears to be at its most legible points</li>
<li><strong>The private sector depends on reliable state data</strong> to plan investment</li>
<li><strong>There's historical precedent</strong>: successful statebuilding efforts in the past are those where state capacity enables observability (Domesday book, Napoleon’s cadastre, 19th century Prussian civil service); deep failures have been where observability was limited (Scott's examples in SLAS, the <em>Gosplan</em>, mid-century US urban renewal à la Jacobs)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s going on?</h2>
<p>Things we definitely know are problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measuring these things is difficult</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legacy IT systems</strong>, data silos, devolution, latency, all create issues</li>
<li><strong>Opacity rents.</strong> arbitrage opportunities from informational asymmetries. If charity effectiveness isn't measured properly, organisations can continue receiving state funding regardless of actual outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of institutional capacity.</strong> Even if the private sector is delivering something, <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2021/11/16/institutional-issues-procurement/" target="_blank">the public sector needs to be a competent client</a>. A lot of the British state lacks good technical capability, the civil service is not structured to reward it, and doing these sorts of measurements well requires technical capability.</li>
</ul>
<p>More speculative explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>British aversion to state control? Maybe we find it quite satisfying that the state is distant – c.f. the ongoing debate around ID cards – and so this creates political economy problems for fixing it</li>
</ul>

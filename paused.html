        <p>Here is a list of paused, suspended, abandoned or otherwise ignored projects. I am trying to be more focussed, and trying to produce better work. I'll write more some other time on my reasoning, and the framework I'm using to adjust my commitments to reflect my changing priorities, but it starts with being upfront and public about what trade-offs I'm making.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For five years, I have been writing, on-and-off, a
            <strong>book-length project on Ã‰variste Galois</strong>, the French mathematician and failed revolutionary. I'm not spending enough time on it to balance out the stress that not spending time on it is causing me. I hope to return to it one day.</li>

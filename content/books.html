  A French gentleman who possessed a large personal library was asked a
  too-familiar question by a visitor to his home. A question so often posed to
  those who own a lot of books – “And have you read them all?” The wise
  collector faced his visitor with an astonished look and replied: “No, and I
  haven’t drunk all the wine in my cellar either.”

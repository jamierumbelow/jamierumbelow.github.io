<p>
  I write Java/TypeScript, PHP, Clojure, Solidity, and prose. I live in London.
  I still haven't figured out what I want to do when I grow up.
</p>

<p>I work in crypto.</p>

<p>
  Before that, I was a founding engineer at <a href="https://pactio.io/">Pactio</a>,
  cohort member at <a href="https://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">Entrepreneur First</a>, a
  freelance software engineer, and a Politics, Philosophy, and Economics
  student.

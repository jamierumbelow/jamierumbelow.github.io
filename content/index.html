<p>
  I write code and prose. I live in London.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I host
  <a href="https://littlespilt.com/"
    >wine tastings for smart, techie/progress people</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Latterly, I founded a proptech startup called <a href="https://buildwithtract.com" target="_blank">Tract</a>, which closed in April 2025.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I was a product engineer at
  <a href="https://conjecture.dev" target="_blank">Conjecture</a> and
  <a href="https://fei.money" target="_blank">Fei Labs</a>, a founding engineer at
  <a href="https://pactio.io/" target="_blank">Pactio</a>, cohort member at
  <a href="https://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">Entrepreneur First</a>, a
  freelance software engineer, and a Politics, Philosophy, and Economics
  student.

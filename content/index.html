<p>
  I write Java/TypeScript, PHP, Clojure, Solidity, and prose. I live in London.
  I still haven't figured out what I want to do when I grow up.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently a cohort member at
  <a href="https://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">Entrepreneur First</a>,
  where I'm building tools and protocols for DeFi.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I worked as a freelance software engineer and studied for degrees
  in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics.

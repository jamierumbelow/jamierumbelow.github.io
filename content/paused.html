  Here is a list of paused, suspended, abandoned or otherwise ignored projects.
  I am trying to be more focussed, and trying to produce better work. I'll write
  more some other time on my reasoning, and the framework I'm using to adjust my
  commitments to reflect my changing priorities, but it starts with being
  upfront and public about what trade-offs I'm making.

    For five years, I have been writing, on-and-off, a
    <strong>book-length project on Ã‰variste Galois</strong>, the French
    mathematician and failed revolutionary. I'm not spending enough time on it
    to balance out the stress that not spending time on it is causing me. I hope
    to return to it one day.

    <strong>My food blog</strong>,
    <a href="https://littleleftover.com">little left over</a>, has been
    neglected for the past couple of years. I have about 4,000 words for various
    pieces written locally, which I will at some point edit and post. But I
    don't expect to write anything new for some time.
